# DealerTrack
Upload a CSV file and visualize the data in ASP.NET MVC

### Running the test
* The project uses nuget packages, so after download the project you'll need to build it to install all the required packages.
* The CSV file structure is pre-defined, so you will have to use the file structure similar to the sample file 'Dealertrack-CSV-Example.csv' for testing
