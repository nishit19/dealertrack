Upload a CSV file and visualize the data in ASP.NET MVC

### Test Specifications

#### Description
As a user, I want to be able to upload a CSV file and visualize it on the Browser
So that we can analyse the file, subsequently allowing development of upcoming features on the system

*	For testing purposes, the CSV file is being provided.
*	CSV file provided is all test data and it does not disclose any real sensitive data
*	Vehicle price currency should be formatted as CAD$
Acceptance Criteria
*	Application shall be browser agnostic. Therefore, it should work on latest version of Chrome, Internet Explorer and Firefox
*	Implement a comprehensive user interface
*	Provide Installation Guide if required. Any readable and accessible format is accepted.
Technical requirements 
*	Web Application must be written in .NET. Application type can be chosen by your own criteria 
(e.g. ASP.NET Web forms, MVC, Core, only APIs combined with front-end framework, etc).
*	If desired, any front-end framework and/or library can be used 
*	For application logic, only .NET framework is permitted, please do not use a third-part framework for reading CSV file specifically. 

### Pre-requisite
* .Net Framework 4.5
* ASP.NET MVC 5

### Running the test
* Build the project to install all the libraries from nuget package manager
* The CSV file structure is pre-defined, so you will have to use the file structure similar to the sample file 'Dealertrack-CSV-Example.csv' for testing
